# BrainImageDataset

The repository includes 3 balanced datasets: HIV-fMRI, HIV-DTI, BP-fMRI.

Each graph will be represented by a 2-dimension numpy array.

All data are stored by pickle (python3 version), the data structure is {'train': {'X': train graphs, 'y': train labels}, 'test':{'X': test graphs, 'y': test labels}}. 

If you have any question, please feel free to concact me.
